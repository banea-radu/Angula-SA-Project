It is built from themes that allow the child to develop reactions and coordination of the whole body.<br><br>Another important aspect is warming up the body, i.e. preparing it for exercise, which is essential to avoid injuries.<br><br>We continue with exercises for attention and concentration and arm ourselves with a lot of patience and words of encouragement (the child should be supported, congratulated for each success, which we should do as often as possible).<br><br>The training ends only after we stretch (exercises for flexibility, mobility and recovery after exertion)."
